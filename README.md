Project Overview

This project compares two algorithmic approaches for solving the submatrix sum query problem:

    Naive method – iterates through all elements in the given submatrix for each query.

    Optimized method – uses a 2D prefix sum matrix to answer each query in constant time.

The project includes:

    Full C++ implementations of both approaches

    Theoretical time & space complexity analysis

    Empirical performance comparison

    Test cases with different matrix sizes
